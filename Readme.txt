Why I chose computer science:
Iâ€™m excited about solving real-world problems with software, collaborating on teams, and building useful tools.

What I hope to learn from software engineering:
I want to practice Git/GitHub workflows, write clean maintainable code, and understand team processes like branching, pull requests, and code reviews.
